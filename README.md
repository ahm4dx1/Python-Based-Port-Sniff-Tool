1. Run the script.
2. Enter the port number (e.g., 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP).
3. Enter the service name (SSH, HTTP, FTP, etc.).
4. Enter the version of the service (e.g., OpenSSH_8.0).
5. The tool will start listening on the selected port and spoof the specified service.

## üîß Example Session
```sh
Enter the port number to spoof (21,22,80,443,25,110): 22
Enter the service name (SSH, HTTP, FTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3): SSH
Enter the version of SSH (e.g., OpenSSH_8.0): OpenSSH_8.0
```

The tool will now emulate SSH on port 22 and return a fake version string when a client connects.
